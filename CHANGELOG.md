## [Unreleased]

### Added
- Text is now embedded as proper text instead of being flattened to paths.
- Made the CLI more flexible in terms of which features you want to include.
- Added `raster-scale` and `text-to-paths` as arguments for the CLI.

### Changed
- Bumped resvg to v0.42, fontdb to v0.18, and pdf-writer to v0.10.
- The `convert_tree` method has been renamed into `to_pdf`.
- The `convert_tree_into` function has been renamed into `to_chunk` and now returns an independent chunk and the object ID of the actual SVG in the chunk.

### Fixed
- Fixed a bug with softmasks on images.

### Removed
- The `convert_str` method has been removed. You should now always convert your SVG string into a `usvg` tree yourself and then call either `to_pdf` or `to_chunk`.
- Removed the option to configure the view box from the API. This might be readded in a later update.
